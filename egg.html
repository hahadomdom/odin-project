        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a non stick frying pan where to drop a teaspoon of oil for each egg to be cooked and warm it without burn it;</li>
            <li>Lay the egg into the pan when the oil starts to sizzle: if you open it before the oil is sizzling the risk is that it will come apart and if you open it after the final result may be an egg burned outside and raw inside</li>
            <li>Cook the egg for a maximum of 5 minutes or the time necessary for the egg to arrive at the recommended temperature of 60-62 degrees when the egg white is firm and the yolk is slightly compact at the bottom and soft above;</li>
            <li>Add salt and seasoning only at the end to prevent the egg white, in contact with other “agents”, fails to clot properly.</li>
            <li>To check the consistency of the egg shake the pan slightly: if the yolk is liquid it will move otherwise it will remain stationary. The proper fried egg provides a very firm egg white and a yolk with a a liquid surface.</li>
        </ol>
